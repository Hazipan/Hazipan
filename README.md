- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hazipan
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Web Development and Game Development
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning JavaScript and popular JavaScript frameworks
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Beginner level projects that use JavaScript or Java
- 📫 How to reach me: rutherfordaaron1@gmail.com

I am a self-taught programmer with a foundation in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also dipped my toes into C++, but don't ask me to program anything in that yet!
I'm just getting started on my Programming journey and am always on the lookout for opportunity to grow and enhance my skills.
I'm currently working my way through FreeCodeCamp.org to gain a foundation in web design so that I can kick start a career!
